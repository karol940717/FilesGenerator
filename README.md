# FilesGenerator
A program for generating documents in a vehicle rental company is a tool that enables the automatic creation of several types of documents, such as rental agreements, assignments, and protocols. The program uses a database containing information about vehicles and the rental company. If some information is missing, the user can manually fill it in before generating the document.

The program was written in Java using the JavaFX library. The graphical interface allows for intuitive use of the tool and quick and easy generation of documents. The program also allows for customization of the appearance of generated documents to suit the needs of the rental company. By automating the document generation process, the program increases work efficiency and minimizes the risk of errors when creating them.
